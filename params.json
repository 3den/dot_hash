It is almost as fast as a plain Hash\r\nsince it's complexity is also linear, `O(n) # where N is the number of nested parents of the given property`.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'dot_hash'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install dot_hash\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nsome_hash = {size: {height: 100, width: 500}, \"color\" => \"red\"}\r\nproperties = some_hash.to_properties\r\n\r\nproperties.size.height # returns 100, it is the same as some_hash[:size][:height]\r\nproperties.color       # returns \"red\", it works with Strings and Symbol keys\r\nproperties[:color]     # returns \"red\", can be used like a hash with string keys\r\nproperties[\"color\"]    # returns \"red\", can be used like a hash with symbol keys\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
